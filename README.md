# Context 
This demo is set to replicate the core of data engineering / cloud engineering work for a multinational company that sells various goods across the globe.

## Problem statement: 
Currently, their sales data is spread across many different data sources making it not easily accessible or analysable by current members of the team.

In an effort to become more data-driven, your organisation wants to make it's sales data accessible from one centralised location.

Your first goal will be to produce a system that stores the current company data in a database so that it's accessed from one centralised location and acts as a single source of truth for sales data.

You will then query the database to get up-to-date metrics for the business.

# Approach and Ways of Working

In this project I'm using cloud Jira to capture requirements and to-dos transferred from the AiCore program to help with structure and implement Agile ways of working. 
* The project is limited to a single contributor, however the board consists of the standard Kanban workflow: TO DO, IN PROGRESS, REVIEW, and DONE. 
* Each milestone is turned into Epics while individual tasks are turned into blue Tasks or sub-tasks depending on the size of the ticket.
